# How to run the frontend
Pre-requisite:
- Download [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager). 
- For clean installation run **rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json** from the terminal while in the frontend folder. Note that the package-lock.json file is like a cache of existing node packages that may be outdated.
- Run **npm install** inside frontend folder to download all the dependency and setup the project.
- Run **npm start** to run our project.

# Suggestions
- It is recommended to first run the backend in a seperate terminal/command prompt window. Backend setup and documentation will be in the backend/README.md
