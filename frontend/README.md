# React + TypeScript + Vite

## Whats different?
- Vite is maintained and supports React 18 and all up to date packages
- TS files will be compiled much faster than Babel 
- All ts and tsx files will be converted to plain javascript to run on a wider range of browsers

## Commands to know
- **npm run dev**: Runs frontend in the dev environment. This means that the devpackages in package.json will be used
- **npm run build**: Runs our frontend in production. This will be what the clients will be able to access
- **npm run lint**: Prints the output of errors in the code

## Frontend setup
- Install node from their website
- If these files are present, delete them: node_modules and package-lock.json
- run **npm install**
- run **npm run dev** to start it up
